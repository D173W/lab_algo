Algorithms and Data Structures II LABS

- Algorithm Analysis
- Data structures
- Known problem-solving strategies

"The aim is for the student to acquire: the ability to understand and describe the problem that an algorithm solves (the “what”) and differentiate it from the way in which it solves it (the “how”); ability to analyze algorithms, compare them according to their efficiency in time and space; ability and habit of identifying relevant abstractions when addressing a computational problem; familiarity with frequently used algorithm design techniques; familiarity with programming (in the C language, among others) of algorithms and data structures, familiarity with the use of various levels of abstraction and programming languages"
